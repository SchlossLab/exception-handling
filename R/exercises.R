careful_remove <- function(filepath) {

}

# 8.5.4 - 1. Inside a package, itâ€™s occasionally useful to check that a package is installed before using it.

check_dependencies <- function() {

}

# 8.6.6 - 4. Why is catching interrupts dangerous? Run this code to find out.
bottles_of_beer <- function(i = 100) {
    message(
        "There are ", i, " bottles of beer on the wall, ",
        i, " bottles of beer."
    )
    while(i > 0) {
        tryCatch(
            Sys.sleep(1),
            interrupt = function(cnd) {
                i <<- i - 1
                if (i > 0) {
                    message(
